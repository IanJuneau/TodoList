# TodoList
This is my first ever github project. I am currently a student studying aerospace engineering.
I am taking a pytyhon class, so I am doing a quick python project for a todo list in the command line.
I got this idea from talking with ChatGPT and think that it will be fun.
In addition to practicing my python I will be attemping to learn about the git workflow. If you have any comments or tips please let me know!
